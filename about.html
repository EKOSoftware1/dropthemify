        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Ekber, I am the founder and CEO of this site. I founded
          this site when I was 17 years old, I believe it will grow a lot. And I
          keep my site up to date by adding new features to it every day. When I
          turn 18, on August 7th, I will bring a great feature to my site. And
          with this feature, you will be able to create your own theme. You will
          be able to add anything you want with the drag and drop method and add
          color to your site. <br /><br />I will make this innovation, which I
          call Creatheme, free for the first few days. But after that, it will
          be paid. So if you want to catch up without paying, send me an e-mail
          and I will add you to the list. And when Creatheme is released, I will
          let you know and allow you to benefit from this service for free.
          That's all I have to say for now, I wish you all success. Profitable
          Days!
